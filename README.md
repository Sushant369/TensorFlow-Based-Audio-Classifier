# TensorFlow-Based-Audio-Classifier

## Project Overview
This project implements an audio classification model using TensorFlow to classify audio clips. It specifically focuses on identifying specific sounds (for example, Capuchin call detections in a forest environment) from audio recordings. The notebook demonstrates the entire workflow, including data loading, preprocessing (converting audio waveforms to spectrograms), model building, training, and making predictions on new audio clips.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- pip

### Dependencies
The project requires various libraries, including TensorFlow, librosa, matplotlib, and others as specified in the notebook.


## To use this classifier, follow these steps:

- Data Loading: Load your audio data. Modify the data loading functions according to your dataset structure.
- Preprocessing: Convert audio clips into spectrograms for model training.
- Model Training: Train the audio classification model using the prepared dataset.
- Evaluation and Prediction: Evaluate the model's performance and make predictions on new audio clips.
- Refer to the Jupyter notebook AudioClassification.ipynb for detailed code and explanations.
